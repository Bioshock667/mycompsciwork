Hello Prof. Mendoza.  I have done a little research on whether a foreign key 
constraint can work so it references one of two primary keys (ie. donor_id
refering to either member_id or patron_id) but all lead to people recommending
a superclass be made instead.  So I made a Person superclass so that he MUST be
 a member, patron or both.  A person who donates money or art is automatically
a patron regardless of whether he is a member or not.  I made modifications
to the relational model to accomedate for this.  I hope this works out to be
a better model. The patron class is still necessary for the patron_id which
links to the cash donations table.
Sincerely, Seth Lemanek
