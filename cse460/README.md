## About
This project was done at California State University, San Bernardino in Dr. Kay Zemoudeh's Operating Systems I (CSE460) class during *insert Quarter Year*.  It was an iterative process that was divided into three phases:
1. writing and testing an assembler and Virtual machine.
*	The assembler reads assembly code files and translate them into "machine code" files.
*	The virtual machine is an abstract class that can load machine code files into its memory and runs it.
2. Writing and testing the operating system.
* The Os is also a c++ class that manages the entire process of compiling, scheduling and terminating processes.
3. Adding memory page management to the OS class
