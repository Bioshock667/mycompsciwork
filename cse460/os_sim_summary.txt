What is your role in the project?
I am the sole programmer of this project.

How did you implement this project?
It was an iterative process that was divided into three phases:
Phase1: writing and testing an assembler and Virtual machine.
	The assembler reads assembly code files and translate them into "machine code" files.
	The virtual machine is an abstract class that can load machine code files into its memory and runs it.
Phase2: Writing and testing the operating system.
	The Os is also a c++ class that manages the entire process of compiling, scheduling and terminating processes.
Phase3: Adding memory page management to the OS class
