   Number in text: P1.19
   Description in text
	Write a program that transforms numbers 1,2,3, ..., 12 into the corresponding month names January, Feburary, March, ..., December.
   Algorithm
	1.Program asks user to enter a number between 1-12
	2.If user fails to do so then program give error message and asks to retype
	3.When the user enters a number from 1-12, program will make a substring from a pre-existing substring
	4.To do this the program will translate the value to 0 and multiples of 9 (9 is the highest amount of letters in a month.
	5.The program will use that value to choose an initial letter in the string, thus choosing a month name and the 8 following letters
	6.The program will display the chosen subtring in the text
