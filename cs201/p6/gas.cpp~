   Description in text
	Implement a class Car with the following properties. A car has a certain fuel efficency
	(measured in miles/gallon or liters/km -pick one) and a certain amount of fuel in the
	gas tank. The efficency is specified in the constructor, and the initial fuel is zero.
	Supply a function drive that simulates driving the car for a certain distance, reducing
	the fuel level in the gas tank, and functions get_gas, to return the current fuel level,
	and add_gas, to tank up.
