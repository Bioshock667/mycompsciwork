/*This program has errors in it.
  They are all in the function called 'flip'.
   If `flip` was correct then the main program would compile
	and run as shown.
   The code for flip does not compile and also has logic errors.
   Correct all the errors in function `flip`.
   Mark your changes on the code below.
   Do NOT mark any change to anything but `flip`.
   'assert( test)' stops the program if the test is false.  It is an excellent tool
     for testing functions and arguments!
