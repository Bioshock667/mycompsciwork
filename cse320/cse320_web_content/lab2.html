	<h1>Lab 2: Comparing Languages</h1>
	<p>This lab demonstration seeks to compare the performance of two programming languages: the C language and its high-level equivalent C++ language.  Often lower-level languages like C are primitive and therefore close to the machine.  This leads to the possible conclusion that C allows greater performance due to lower complexity.  Will this be proven here?</p>
	<h3>C++ Language Test</h3>
	<p>On of the best ways to test the performance of a computer languages is to code a sorting algorithm and test it.  In order to do this, a program called bubsort.cpp was downloaded off of <a href= cse.csusb.edu/egomez/320labs.html>Prof. Gomez's website</a>, compiled, and tested.  The code is shown down below.</p>

// program bubsort
//   timing test for C++ vector and C array comparison

#include <time.h>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>


using namespace std;


double milisecond_timer(){
struct timespec itval;
/* returns system time in miliseconds - 
   this routine compiles with gcc or g++ */

/* for gcc, compile with "gcc -lrt" */

	clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME,&itval);
	return itval.tv_sec*1000+itval.tv_nsec/1e6;
}


int bubble(vector<int>& x){
int i,swap,count=0;
bool done=false;
/* bubble sort - C++ vector version */
/* done is set to true at the start of
   the while loop - if any items in the
   array or vector are out of order, they are
   swapped and done is set to false.
   when nothing is out of order, done stays
   true in the inner loop and the while
   loop ends.

   because the array is passed by reference
   changes to the array are visible in main.

   count tracks how many loops it takes
   to order the array.*/

while( !done){
	count++;
	done=true;

	for(i=1;i<x.size();i++){
		if(x[i]<x[i-1]) {swap=x[i];
				x[i]=x[i-1];
				x[i-1]=swap;
				done=false;}
		}
	}
	return count; // return number of loops


}

int main(){
int i,c;
double t0,t1;
vector<int> tarray(30000);


srand(milisecond_timer()); // initialize random number generator

// initialize array of random integers

for(i = 0; i<tarray.size(); i++)
	tarray[i]=rand();

// print first item 
cout << endl << "data size =" << tarray.size() << " first =" << tarray[1] << endl;

t0=milisecond_timer(); // save start time
c=bubble(tarray); // call bubble sort routine
t1=milisecond_timer(); // save end time

// print number of loops, time in miliseconds, first array item to verify that it has changed
cout << "number of iterations =" << c << " miliseconds =" << t1-t0 << " first =" << tarray[1] << endl;

	<p>This code was compilied with the g++ compiler.</p>
	<div>g++ bobsort.cpp -o bubsort</div>
	<p>Afterwards, the resulting program was executed 4 times with the average recorded.  Afterwards the code was compiled with the highest level of optimization.</p>
	<div>g++ -O3 bubsort.cpp -o bubsort2</div>
	<p>Afterwards, it was tested 4 times.</p>
	<h3>C Language Test</h3>
	<p>bubsort was translated to C with minor changes and compiled as a C program as cbubsort.c.  The program was also tested 4 times.  This is the resulting code:</p>

	return itval.tv_sec*1000+itval.tv_nsec/1e6;
}


int bubble(int x[], int size){
int i,swap,count,done = 0;
/* bubble sort - C vector version */
/* done is set to 1 at the start of

   when nothing is out of order, done stays
   1 in the inner loop and the while
   loop ends.

				x[i]=x[i-1];
				x[i-1]=swap;
				done=0;}
		}
	}
	return count; // return number of loops

}

int main(){
int i,c;
double t0,t1;
int aSize = 30000;
int tarray[aSize];


srand(milisecond_timer()); // initialize random number generator

// initialize array of random integers

for(i = 0; i<aSize; i++)
	tarray[i]=rand();

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>When comparing nominal compilations, the C language program performed faster then C++.  This proves that C has less complexity and therefore runs faster than C++.  But when compiled with maximum optimization (-O3), the resulting program way outperformed the C program.</p>
	<p>What can be taken away from this is yes C++ is a more complex language than C but it can still outperform C with max optimization.  Also, C++ gives programmers more tools to create algorithms than C does like vectors and strings.  Overall, C++ is the better language.</p>
